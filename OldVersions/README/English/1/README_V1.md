## Language

The system is currently written in C, but it will be supported with Objective-C, Objective-C++, Swift, and (for early versions before wOS 12) AppleScript

### Programming language support

- C is based on portable C11 (as of wOS 4)
- Objective-C is bumped up to version 2.0 (As of wOS 4)
- Objective-C++ is bumped up to version 2.0 (As of wOS 4)
- AppleScript is bumped up to version 2.1 (As of wOS 4)
- Swift is bumped up to version 3.0 (As of wOS 6)
- Python support is not included by default
- Ruby support is not included by default

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.
